# Word Relay

Word Relay is a game designed to improve QWERTY typing rate and efficiency. Words
appear one by one in the stack as time progresses. There's a limited 'Stack' that fills up after a
certain number of words have appeared. Once you type the topmost word of the stack correctly, that word is
removed from the stack.

The score is calculated based on how fast you are able to clear that word, and a
multiplier. The multiplier increases with every word the player types correctly and
resets on any mistype. Every 500 points you score, you move on to the next level which further
decreases the Stack limit by 5 and increments the level up bonus!

If 'Stack' is full, itâ€™s game over! Additionally, The player can then submit their score and compare
with a leaderboard that contains a list of top ten players.

Also, if you're lucky you might encounter Trending Characters often! These include %, @, #, $, &, and ?. They
give you bonus points irrespective of the level you're playing!
